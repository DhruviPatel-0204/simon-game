This is my project file for the Simon game. It is made using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
Game description: When you start the game, the Simon device lights up one of four colored buttons in a random sequence, accompanied by a sound unique to each color. The player must then press the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the game adds another step to the sequence, making it progressively longer and more challenging. The goal is to remember and replicate the entire sequence correctly. If the player presses a button out of order, the game ends, and the player must start over.
